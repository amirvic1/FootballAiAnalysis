The project focuses on the personal development of skills in AI and Machine Learning.
All code will be on Master branch.

Part 1 of the project: 

   Using Python and YOLOv5s for object detection, we successfully trained our model using a Roboflow dataset consisting of approximately 600 images.
   Ideally, the model would have used the YOLOv5x version with 100 epochs for better precision. However, given the time and resources available, I opted for YOLOv5s with 10 epochs to ensure faster training.
   While using YOLOv5x and a higher number of epochs would result in better precision and a longer training period, the chosen parameters were sufficient for the scope of this project.
